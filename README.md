### ThoughtTracker

An app that helps users track their thoughts and emotions throughout the day. Users can quickly jot down their feelings, concerns, or noteworthy events, categorize them, and add timestamps. The app provides simple visualizations and trends to help users gain insights into their mental state over time. Thought Tracker aims to improve self-awareness and assist users in identifying patterns or triggers for certain emotions.
The idea of this MVP is to showcase the UI capabilities in Volt MX and also create a private app that everyone can safely use without worrying about their data being sent outside their devices.

### Features Used

- Actions: To change the colors and skins of the widgets on Slider (onSelection) 
- Skins: To customize various skins for better UX 
- Data Storage (Object Service): To store the mood data into objects

### Next Steps

1. Create authentication using VoltMXâ€™s Local Authentication API (https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/touch_id.html)
2. View all tracked moods in one page
3. Use IBM Watson API to analyse the mood over a period of time to give insights to users.
4. Make the storage better with proper structure and enable indexing so that when it becomes huge, it becomes easier to track.
5. Add Journaling where users can store their thoughts too along with their current mood to get better insights of how they are doing.
